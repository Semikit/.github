# Semikit Organization

**Building the future of fantasy retro gaming.**

Semikit is an open-source organization dedicated to developing the Cicada-16 fantasy console ecosystem. We create both the specification for a virtual 16-bit game console and the tools needed to bring retro-inspired games to life.

## Our Projects

### Cicada-16

The **Cicada-16** is a complete fantasy console specification that recreates the magic of 16-bit game development from the 90s and early 2000s. It's a virtual machine specification built from scratch, featuring:

- **Custom 16-bit CISC CPU** with a carefully designed instruction set
- **Memory banking** for expanding beyond the 16-bit address space
- **Dedicated graphics hardware** (Picture Processing Unit - PPU)
- **Audio processing capabilities** (Audio Processing Unit - APU)
- **Complete toolchain** including the official `casm` assembler

The Cicada-16 specification provides a stable, focused platform that encourages creativity through thoughtful hardware constraints, making it perfect for both nostalgic developers and newcomers learning game development fundamentals.

### Semikit Emulator

**Semikit** is the official emulator for the Cicada-16 platform. It accurately simulates the Cicada-16's custom hardware, allowing you to run, test, and play games developed for the console. Semikit brings the Cicada-16 specification to life, providing a complete development and gaming experience.

## What is a Fantasy Console?

A fantasy console is a virtual game console with deliberately chosen limitations that simulate the experience of developing for retro hardware. Unlike emulators that replicate real machines, fantasy consoles like Cicada-16 are designed from scratch with modern tools and sensibilities while maintaining the creative constraints and charm of classic game development.
